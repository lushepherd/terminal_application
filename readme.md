### This is Term 1 Assignment 3 - Terminal Application.<a id="intro"></a>
For my assignment, I decided to create a recipe application. Users will be able add recipes, and retrieve them to modify/ delete/ view/ search/ export to PDF.<br><br>
The code style guide I will be adhering to is Pep 8 - https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
I am using the VsCode formatter extension autopep8 to ensure code is in line with this requirement. I have provided some of the main points below:

- Prefers use of 4 spaces for indentation over tabs

- Limited line length of 79 characters

- Two blank lines separating main functions/ class definitions

- Imports should go in order of:
    1. Standard library imports
    2. Related third party imports
    3. Local application/ library specific imports

## Features

### Feature 1: Add new recipes with ingredients and instructions <a id="feature1"></a>

Users are able to add new recipes with ingredients and instructions to 5 different categories:
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Snacks
- Dessert

They are sorted alphabetically for easy navigation.<br>
Users are also able to amend or delete recipes they have created.<br>
One a recipe has been created, users receive a confirmation message so they know it has been successful.<br>
I have implemented exception handling for invalid inputs from the user.

### Feature 2: Modify, Delete and View current recipes <a id="feature2"></a>

These features all have very similar code so I am rolling them into one. 
With this feature, users are able to retrieve recipes from the database to edit name/ method/ ingredient, delete a current recipe or view a recipe.<br>
I have implemented error handling for empty lists.

### Feature 3: Allow users to search for recipes based on ingredients.<a id="feature3"></a>

With this feature, users are able to search the database for recipes by name or by ingredient. Any matches are displayed alphabetically for them to click to view.<br>
I have implemented error handling for invalid inputs and no matching search results.

### Other <a id="feature4"></a>

Users will also be able to export recipes to a PDF to save to their local computer in an easy-to-read printable format.<br>

### Implementation Plan <a id="asana"></a>

I have used Asana to break this task down into smaller items. Each item is a task to be ticked off. Some tasks have a description and some have sub-tasks to break these down even further.<br>
The project management board was the first thing I completed and each item have a due date. This allowed me to keep track of where I'm up to and how much further I needed to go. If I completed a task early it was checked off and I immediately started on the next item of the list.<br>
I have provided detailed screenshots below.

#### Completed Asana and final thoughts <a id="completedasana"></a>

![Completed Asana board](/images/Completedasana.png)

I have successfully completed my assignment board within the timeframe. I do have a few thoughts on the way I arranged my tasks and how to improve for future use.
- When I started this assignment I wasn't really sure how to structure my tasks or how to implement my features. I started off with each of my features broken down into smaller tasks assuming I would work on one feature at a time until each were completed.
- Instead, I created each feature and got them all working before I went down my checklist for each. I completed the "create function" item for each within the first day or two, then spent time working down the list. I also added extra subtasks as I went along - <br><br>
![New add recipe checklist](/images/asanalist.png)<br><br>
- I do understand this would very much be due to my lack of experience, however I still found tracking in this way to be very helpful when I was wondering what I should do next/ how to proceed. It also ensured I had less chance of missing things that were important.

## System Requirements and Installation <a id="requirements"></a>

### Required OS
- Linux
- Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- MacOS

Requires python3 and pip3 to be installed.
To run the application, please follow the help documentation below.

### Help Documentation <a id="help"></a>

1. Ensure you are currently in the src folder in the terminal.
2. Execute the bash script with the following prompts:
```
chmod +x setup.sh run.sh
```

```
bash setup.sh
```
3. The first command will allow permissions for you to execute it. The script will check if Python is installed and also check the version is Python3.
4. If the above requirement is met, it will create and activate a virtual environment, install requirements from requirements.txt and run the program.
5. Yes, you will be subject to my random loading messages (sorry, not sorry!)

##### Troubleshooting <a id="install-troubleshoot"></a>
##### <u>Python version out of date</u><a id="updatepython"></a>
If you receive the following message when running the application, you will need to update your version of Python.
      
        Your Python is old
        Like a dinosaur fossil
        Time to evolve it (Upgrade to Python 3!)

[Here](https://ioflood.com/blog/update-python-step-by-step-guide/) are some step-by-step guides on how to update your version of Python depending on which OS you are using.

##### <u>Python not installed</u><a id="installpython"></a>

If you receive this message, you will need to install Python3.

    [^\u0000-\u007F]+
    ```
    3. Copy and paste the text you would like to check. Remove any items that are highlighted, then copy and paste the new text into your recipe via the modify function. Now try to export your recipe again.
