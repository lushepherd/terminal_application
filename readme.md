## My Recipes Terminal Application

Github: https://github.com/lushepherd/your-recipe-book

This is Term 1 Assignment 3 - Terminal Application.

For my assignment, I decided to create a recipe application. 
The code style guide I will be adhering to is Pep 8 - https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

## Features

### Feature 1: Add new recipes with ingredients and instructions

Users are able to add new recipes with ingredients and instructions to 5 different categories:
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Snacks
- Dessert

They are sorted alphabetically for easy navigation.<br>
Users are also able to amend or delete recipes they have created.<br>
One a recipe has been created, users receive a confirmation message so they know it has been successful.<br>
I have implemented exception handling for invalid inputs from the user.

### Feature 2: Display a list of available recipes. 

With this feature, users are able to print a list of the available recipes in a category, or print all recipes from each category. Recipes are sorted alphabetically within each category for ease of navigation.<br>
I have implemented error handling for empty lists.

### Feature 3: Allow users to search for recipes based on ingredients.

With this feature, users are able to search for recipes based on ingredients. There is an additional function allowing users to filter by category.<br>
I have implemented error handling for invalid inputs or empty results.

### Other

Users will also be able to export recipes to a PDF to save to their local computer in an easy-to-read printable format.<br>


### Implementation Plan

I have used Asana to break this task down into smaller items. Each item is a task to be ticked off. Some tasks have a description and some have sub-tasks to break these down even further.<br>
The project management board was the first thing I completed and each item have a due date. This allowed me to keep track of where I'm up to and how much further I needed to go. If I completed a task early it was checked off and I immediately started on the next item of the list.<br>
I have provided detailed screenshots below.
